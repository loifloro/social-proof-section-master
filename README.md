## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass Guidelines 
- BEM Methodology


### What I learned

God! It took too much time just to finish this project. I applied responsive designs I learned using grids by [Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-slCsOrLcc&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG)

I also applied [Sass Architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/) on this project even though its kinda messy. Thanks to the incredible author of this article 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, 1fr));
```


### Continued development

On the future project i will try to master using this 7-1 architecture, but for now Im gonna enhanced developing using grids.
